## Azure, Windows and Xamarin: Using the cloud to power your cross-platform applications 

**Abstract:** Most mobile applications are connecting to a server at some point, either to get data that needs to be shown to the user, or to save data collected by the mobile device. This is where Microsoft Azure has the potential of making your life as a developer much easier. The cloud came a long way, and you can now build cloud infrastructure very easily and for a reasonable cost. New computing models like serverless functions or globally distributed databases are changing the game. What was earlier reserved to large firms with an army of IT pro consultants is now available for everyone with a web browser. In this session, Microsoft's Cloud Developer Advocate Laurent Bugnion will guide you through this journey and show you how Azure Functions, Cosmos DB, Static Web Servers, Cognitive Services and other features and tools can be used in your cross-platform applications.

## .NET Standard, .NET Core, Why and How?

**Abstract:** .NET Standard is the new way to create portable assemblies. After learning about portable class libraries in the past years, it is now time to upgrade our game and start coding for Linux, Mac OS and other platforms in addition to Windows. More and more libraries are getting ported to .NET Standard, sometimes really easily and sometimes more painfully. In this session, Laurent Bugnion, the creator of the popular open source MVVM Light Toolkit, will help you understand why .NET Standard can benefit you. We'll talk about ASP.NET Core, see how easily we can containerize and deploy our web applications to Linux on Azure. Finally Laurent will also talk about his experiences converting his open source framework to .NET Standard.
